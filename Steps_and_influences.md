# Case_Study_Test_Submission

There so many data are not understandable 

Steps Detail

Uploadd the data as csv file
Getting insights from the data
Applied all the basic attributes and functions for the data reading.
Later I have droped the highly correlated columns
Used one hot encoding for object dtypes
Applied concat to create the new dataser with all integers
Defined target variable as G3
Applied the train_test_split on the data
Initially used Decision tree classifier to check that how the model responds
Later used Decision tree regressor to get the score for train and test data
It is taking too much time for data cleaning so I decided to move towards modeling rather than investing more time for cleaning.
Later I was about to apply for Randomforest Regressor, Linear Regression,
